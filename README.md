# Blockchain

This project is a simple implementation of a blockchain in Java. It demonstrates the basic concepts of blockchain technology, including blocks, hashing, and proof of work.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Java and Visual Studio Code installed on your machine.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders:

- `src`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `lib`: Contains the external libraries (e.g., Gson) used in the project.
- `bin`: Contains the compiled output files.

## Dependencies

This project uses the Gson library for JSON serialization. You can add the Gson library to your project by following these steps:

1. Download the `gson-2.6.2.jar` file and place it in the `lib` folder.
2. Configure the classpath to include the `gson-2.6.2.jar` file.

## Running the Project

To run the project, open the `BlockChain.java` file in Visual Studio Code and run the `main` method. This will create a simple blockchain with three blocks and print the blockchain data in JSON format.

## Project Structure

- `Block.java`: Defines the `Block` class, which represents a single block in the blockchain.
- `BlockChain.java`: Contains the `main` method and manages the blockchain.
- `StringUtil.java`: Contains utility methods for hashing.
